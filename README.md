# Hey, how you doing? ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adithya, a CS grad student at the **Johns Hopkins University**. \
Presently, I'm researching on leveraging emergent sparsity in LLMs with Dr. Burns to optimize inference. \
I'm reachable via my [LinkedIn][3] or my email: vgadham1 at jhu dot edu.

Aside from the professional stuff, I love playing multiplayer video games, reading novels/manga and ricing my Arch Linux configuration! :D

#### Accomplishments

Reverse Chronologically, I've done the following (excl. personal projects),
- Research at Johns Hopkins University
  + Under [Dr. Randal Burns](https://randalburns.github.io/), I'm building a sparse matrix workloads dataset to support SpMM kernel performance benchmarking for LLMs. The data for the instances are retrieved from popular (zero order/first order/second order) pruning strategies.
  + Under [Dr. Soudeh Ghorbani](https://soudeh.net), I worked on investigating microbursts via OMNeT++/INET simulations for Meta's DCNs.
  + Course Assistant for the Blockchains & Cryptocurrencies course taken up by [Dr. Matthew Green](https://spar.isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/).
- Data Engineer at Bajaj Markets
  + Had an amazing team to work with; spun up the DRIFT framework to orchestrate over 500+ jobs for BI Reporting, Data Analysis, and DWH construction.
  + Revamped the offer generation pipeline to concurrently process 30+ million customers, using Parquet, AWS S3, Celery, DuckDB and Python.
  + Created interfaces for data analysts and SQL BI teams to create data transformation jobs. These jobs could be tracked, scheduled, and provided notifications on completion.
- Research at VIT AP
  + Under the guidance of [Dr. Rohit Kumar Das](https://rohitdas01.github.io/), I've presented the impact of [Intelligent Systems in Advanced Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10126117) at the I2CT conference in Pune, India, and published a paper on [Automated Station Migration in SDNs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-023-05392-z) in the Journal of Supercomputing.
- President of the Open Source Community at VIT AP
  + I've been part of and led the development of three open source projects, 50+ events and 3+ initiatives during my time as an undergrad.
  + Set up a pretty awesome foundation for the future generations of the club. Now they've got their [own aesthetic](https://oscvitap.org/) going on for them.

#### Check out my website!
Sometimes, Hugo is just too cool to pass up, so I used it and made a website for myself. It provided the feature set of a blog too, and since I wanted to log my work, it checks out.
Here's my [website][4]!
